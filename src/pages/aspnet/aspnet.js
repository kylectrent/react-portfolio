        <p>I helped to develop a number of internal web applications using Asp.Net. 
            These applicaitons are being used by employees at my current role to track hours, payroll and staffing.
            These applications primarily use razor pages, as well as JQuery, Ajax, vanilla Javascript and HTML/CSS with a back end
            built in C# with SQL. One was used to track and enroll in benefits for Microsoft partners and had a front end with
            React.js and typescript.
